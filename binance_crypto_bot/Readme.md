## Trading bot 2 (RSI)
Relative Strength Index (RSI) is a type of momentum indicator that looks at the pace of recent price 
changes so as to determine whether a stock is ripe for a rally or a selloff.
When an asset is overbought, it means the price is in bullish momentum for an extended period. 
Therefore, itâ€™s trading at a higher price than its inherent value
When an asset is oversold, it indicates that an asset is trading below what it is worth at its current price. 
This happens when the asset is sold at an undervalued price over an extended period, signaling that
it is already at its all-time low.
The RSI overbought and oversold readings are as follow:
A level above 70 is considered an overbought reading.
At levels below 30, prices are considered to be in oversold territory.
The rules are simple: Enter(buy) if the RSI crosses below 30, and exit(Sell) when it crosses above 70
